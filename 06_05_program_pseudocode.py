# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.

# Task that I want to accomplish using programming: Keybind function that is pressed at start that opens up all 
# recently closed tabs that doesnt require me to click anything.

# Step 1: Press the esc button 
# Step 2: Script upon the key being pressed runs a automatic script that runs code to open up all last used chrome tabs
# Step 3: Slowly open up all last used tabs on chrome rather then indivudally going into history and opening them
